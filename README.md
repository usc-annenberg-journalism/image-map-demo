# Making Image Maps Demo
These are the files we'll use to demonstrate how to make a simple image map. You can do many things with the image map you create, from simply linking to a bunch of pages from the hotspots, to creating popups when people click on a hotspot. 

For the purposes of this demo, you'll have to go to this website to actually create the image map:

Fancybox is included in these files but it's not mandatory for making the actual image maps. It's only needed if you want to make popups when people click on the hotspots.
